# Final Project Cornell MAE 5730 
My project is to model the dynamics of a human taking a zipline through a arbitrarily defined 2D course. The human, or “spy” in the context of this document consists of a 3-link body connected to a point mass. The point mass is representative of the zipline trolley, and the 3 links represent the head-neck connection, neck-waist connection and then waist to toe connection.
